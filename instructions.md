# Chirpfy (Rust CLI Tweet Refiner)

## Overview

A command-line tool written in Rust that uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to transform draft tweets/posts into polished, tech-savvy content that reflects a product-focused entrepreneurial voice.

## Goals

- Transform verbose technical thoughts into impactful content
- Maintain technical credibility while being approachable
- Focus on product/tech insights with entrepreneurial angles
- Keep responses sharp and contrarian when appropriate

## User Flow

1. User runs `chirpify "<draft text>"`
2. Rust program interfaces with OpenAI's API, applying the "Tweet Agent" prompt
3. Program prints the refined content to stdout

## Functional Requirements

- **CLI Command**:
  ```
  chirpfy "Shame on me that I did not consider rust before. Bottleneck from my mind got removed."
  ```
- **Output**:
  - The refined content with proper formatting
  - Support for both short tweets and longer posts (up to 5,000 chars)
- **Configuration**:
  - OpenAI API key via environment variable
- **Error Handling**:
  - Clear, actionable error messages
  - Graceful fallback for API failures

## Technical Stack

- **Rust** with modern idioms
- **reqwest** for OpenAI API interactions
- **clap** for CLI argument parsing
- **tokio** for async runtime
- **serde** for JSON serialization
- **thiserror** for error handling

## System Prompt

The system prompt is now stored in `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`. Users can:

1. Modify this file directly
2. Use a custom prompt file by setting `CHIRPFY_PROMPT_PATH`

See the default prompt in `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` for reference.

## High-Level Implementation

1. **Initialize OpenAI Client**:
   - Configure with API key from environment
   - Set up HTTP client with proper headers
2. **Process Input**:
   - Parse CLI args with proper error handling
   - Validate input length (max 5,000 chars)
3. **Generate Response**:
   - Send request to OpenAI's Chat API
   - Handle API errors gracefully
4. **Output**:
   - Print only the refined content
   - Exit with appropriate status code

## Example Usage

```bash
# Command
chirpfy "Shame on me that I did not consider rust before. Bottleneck from my mind got removed."

# Potential Output
"After years of Go & TypeScript, Rust's ownership model just clicked. It's not just about memory - it's about modeling complex systems correctly from day one. ðŸ¦€"
```
