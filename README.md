# Chirpfy ðŸ¦€

A Rust CLI tool that refines your tweets using OpenAI's GPT-4. It transforms verbose technical thoughts into concise, impactful tweets while maintaining your professional voice.

## Features

- Transforms draft tweets into polished, tech-savvy content
- Maintains technical credibility while being approachable
- Focuses on product/tech insights with entrepreneurial angles
- Keeps responses sharp and contrarian when appropriate
- Uses emojis sparingly (max 1-2)
- Ensures tweets stay within Twitter's 280-character limit
